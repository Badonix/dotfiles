Here are some of my dotfiles, I just dumped it here to save for myself but feel free to use it. It's mostly trash but it may help somebody

### Things...

1\. Rofi catpuccin theme need to be installed from their [repo](https://github.com/catppuccin/rofi)

2\. You will need feh and picom installed

Brave had some issues on kwallet, it was asking me on and on so I installed some weird things and the solution if I remember correctly was to set the password to blank for kwallet and also I need to install some authenticator agent and I installed the lxqt-policykit-agent (that should be running so I added it in i3 config)

That's the things I got stuck on, you will figure out everything by yourself from i3 config

OOH and you need wallpaper in Pictures/wallpaper.png, if you want any other directory change it in config :)
